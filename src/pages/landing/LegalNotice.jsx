              <p className='text-gray-400 text-justify'>
                As service providers, we are liable for our own contents of these websites
                according to Sec. 7, paragraph 1 German Telemedia Act (TMG). However,
                according to Sec. 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act (TMG), service providers

              <p className='text-gray-400 text-justify'>
                Legal obligations to remove information or to block the use of information
                remain unchallenged. In this case, liability is only possible at the time
                of knowledge about a specific violation of law. Illegal contents will be
                removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.

                linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that
                there has been a violation of law. Illegal links will be removed
                immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.
